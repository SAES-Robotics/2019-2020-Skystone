# 2019-2020-Skystone
This is where we put crappy code

## Autonomous
Goals:
- use [safe paths](https://www.reddit.com/r/FTC/comments/d1m6bs/safe_autonomous_paths_for_skystone/) for movement
- identify and deliver skystones, placing them on the alliance foundation
- move the foundation to the building zone
- park under the skybridge

## Driver Controlled
Goals:
- use [sliding controls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQw4w9WgXcQ) for the arms
- allow for simultaneous panning and turning
